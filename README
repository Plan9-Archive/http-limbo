# status

useful, but probably has some buglets lingering in rarely exercised
code paths.


# about

this is a http library, and simple sample http download client.
the library supports both reading & writing requests & responses.

some features:

- ssl (using inferno's ssl device)
- can do deflate negotiation for requests
- supports low-level operations (reading/writing request/response)
  as well as high-level operations (pass request, get file descriptor
  to read response from (hiding intricacies of ssl, deflate and/or
  http chunks)
- supports http 1.0/1.1 and versionless "0.9"
- can request through proxy


# install

to use, make a "mkconfig" (symlink/bind the one from your inferno
install here) and "mk install".


# licence & author

# todo:

- lib: don't reinvent url parsing?  but use (one of the two?) url
  libs in inferno.
- lib: rename it from mhttp to http, once i have modified all my
  local programs to use this new lib (instead of an older version)
- lib: use factotum to deal with auth requests?
- lib: do ssl better, e.g. with verifying certificates.  but that
  is a more generic inferno problem.  same with problem that
  non-"connection-close" connections hang until timeout (ssl libs
  read() is like a readn(), and we use bufio so more data is requested
  then is present).
- lib: add higher-level functions for retrieving urls?  that do
  redirects too?  old lib had that.  get() needs to be improved.
- lib: detect content-range in response, and read less.  now we
  never complete reading the response body.
- lib: allow some events on high-level request (which handles
  redirects) send info on a channel (info about redirections).  perhaps
  other info too.
- lib: check ndb to see if a proxy should be used, not per request?
  that means all programs using http lib get proxy stuff for free,
  without having to set anything.  but cannot be disabled either...
- lib: for ssl, use CONNECT to talk to the remote host?

- write manual page for library?  once it stabilizes

- hget: reinstate -n for allowing redirs, and -R for sending referers.
- hget: reinstate -q for being more verbose.
